            <h2>Leading Technology</h2>
            <p>Whether it's an application for Mobile Phones, Tablets, or Desktops, we make use of various languages and practices to develop for every platform. These skills and forms of development are not typically taught as part of a Computer Science Degree and yet they are essential and extremely employable in the modern day tech industry. Hence the students of our club will find themselves with the advantage of being more employable for internships and jobs out of college than their fellow graduates.

            <h2>Across Devices</h2>
            <p>Using a standard for development across web apps (HTML5/CSS), IOS, and ANDROID, including universal layouts and UI, makes for seamless apps that are accessible across all devices. Having a standard reduces the need to be more devoted to one platform over another and allows for the realistic view of being agnostic with technology.

            <h2>Smart Design</h2>
            <p>Have you ever accessed a website on your phone only to find it wasn't "mobile friendly" leading to bizarre layouts? The Application Development club practices Industry Design standards for friendly UI no matter the platform. An application should look as good on a mobile phone as it does on a full Desktop.

             <p>The Application Development club believes in an open friendly community, there is no standard of previous experience, and we are willing to help anyone willing to learn App Development. We are majority Computer Science students, we listen to a lot of music, and get caught on a lot of dorky topics. Come ready to help build an active and participating community.

             <p>For those that are willing to take their development to the next level, we will be marketing the clubs skills and creating oppurtunities for members of our club to work with an actual customer, discuss the end product, sketch designs and plan, and create a fully functioning, well implemented, and beautifully designed Application for our customers. Talk about a Resume builder.
